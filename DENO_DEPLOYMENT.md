# Deno Deployment Guide

This guide explains deployment considerations for your SvelteKit application.

## Important Note About Prisma and Deno

**This application uses Prisma as its database client, which is specifically designed for Node.js environments.** Prisma is not compatible with Deno deployments because:

- Prisma Client is generated with Node.js-specific code
- Prisma requires Node.js runtime APIs that are not available in Deno
- The Prisma ecosystem is built for the Node.js ecosystem

## Deployment Recommendations

Instead of Deno, consider deploying to Node.js-compatible platforms such as:
- Vercel (recommended for SvelteKit)
- Netlify
- Railway
- Node.js hosting providers

## If You Must Deploy to Deno

If you absolutely need to deploy to Deno, you would need to:

1. Replace Prisma with a Deno-compatible database solution
2. Refactor all database interactions throughout the application
3. This would be a significant undertaking affecting most of the codebase

## Other Improvements Made

The following issues have been resolved for better Deno/Node.js compatibility:

### Node.js Built-in Modules
Deno requires Node.js built-in modules to be imported with the `node:` prefix. All imports like:
- `import path from "path"` → `import path from "node:path"`
- `import fs from "fs"` → `import fs from "node:fs"`
- `import crypto from "crypto"` → `import crypto from "node:crypto"`

Have been updated in the codebase.

### Missing .svelte-kit/tsconfig.json
Updated `tsconfig.json` to not depend on the generated SvelteKit config file during build.
